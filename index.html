      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          The web is a bunch of computers that communicate with
          each other. A web page is a text document written in a language called HTML. Web browsers read these documents, and then interpret and display them. When a person goes to a web page like
          www.google.com, their computer sends a
          <em>HTTP Request</em> to
          a <em>server</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends
          it back to the user's computer where a <em>
          web browser</em> interprets the page and displays it on
          the user's screen.

        <p>
          HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup
          Language.</em> HTML documents form the majority of the
          content on the web.
        </p>
        <p>
          HTML documents contain <em>text
          content</em> which describes "what you see" and
          <em>markup</em> which describes
          "how it looks". <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48724340">This

        <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          HTML documents are made of HTML
          <b>elements</b>. When writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML
          <b>tags</b>.

          B  /B this makes text bold and the beginning and at the end.
          Example:
          <em>HTML</em> is <b>reasonably straightforward</b>
          The code EM /EM  makes text have emphasis it looks like italics at the beginning and the end <a href =www.udacity.com”>HTML</a>  this will make the work HTML hyperlink to www.udacity.com
          a href is a void tag
          <a href="www.udacity.com">my favorite</a> will make the words “my favorite” to a hyperlink to www.udacity.com.
          Images IMG used when you want the site to refer to another site to pull a image. Images don’t have end tags instead they include alt which is alternate text that will display in the event that the image doesn’t display and is required by the websites as this will show text explaining that that image did not load etc. or is unavailable and is good for the blind etc.
          Example:  <img src="http://www.udacity.com/cs253x/hipmunk.png" alt="hipmunk!">

        Why Computers are Stupid
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          Computers are stupid because they interpret instructions literally. This makes them very
          unforgiving since a small mistake by a programmer can cause huge problems in a program. 
          </p>
          <p>
          How Coding Works
          Coding happens when programmers write text in a language that a computer can understand. The computer can then follow the instructions the programmer wrote. For example, the computer might do this by making text like this:
          I'm <b>learning</b> to code!
          look like this: I'm learning to code! For example, if you forget to close a B tag, the computer won't be able to figure out what you had intended to make bold. This "stupidity" can be very frustrating, but it also gives programmers incredible power: if you know how to talk to a computer then you can tell it to do anything you want.

        Inline vs Block Elements
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          HTML elements are either inline
          or B block closing B. Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them. Inline elements are commands such as STRONG, IMG, BR, SPAN, and A,
          </p>
          <p>
          P element boxes the text and can have height and width on the contrary of BR as these are inline text that cannot have specific heights or width as they are for text only and refer to B, EM, and IMG.
        </p>
        <p>
          Multiple white space or lines use the BR which is a void tag because it has no content it has no closing. P is not a void and does have closing and it stands for paragraph. DIV, P and FORM are not inline instead they create boxes around the text or form.

        The "tree-like structure" of HTML
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          The "tree-like structure" comes from the fact that HTML
          elements can have other elements inside of them. You can
          draw this relationship like a family tree. My mother
          had multiple children. So did her mother, and so on...
        </p>
        <p>
          In a browser, this structure shows up as a series of nested boxes. There are boxes inside of boxes inside of boxes, and so on.

      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          When you read an HTML document as
          <em>text</em>, you see a wave of
          changing indentations going up and down the left side
          of the document. The more indented an element is, the
          more deeply nested its corresponding "box" is.

        Text Editors (for programming)
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          When writing code, programmers use special text editors
          (like Sublime Text for example). These editors make the
          programmer's life easier. For example, some text editors
          will automatically generate a closing HTML tag when you
          write an opening tag. Programmers Can't Remember Everything 
          there are too many details to keep everything in your head. And that's okay. If you forget how to make text italic in HTML, you can always just look it up.

          Replace place holder text with some text - the final document is saved to gwenique’s folder named Adding CSS Style to HTML Structure and saved in Codepen.  I used Sublime to link the tabs of code using the link feature <s></s>hown in instructor notes. You can also use styling using the style code instead of having to link the tabs.

        Avoiding Repetition
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          Avoiding repetition is important for a variety of reasons.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Avoiding Errors:</b> When programmers <em>don't</em> avoid repetition, they will often have to do the same thing over and over. This may mean copy and pasting certain style attributes into many HTML elements or rewriting the same code (sometimes with minor differences) many times. This can lead to errors when the programmer decides to make a change to something. If they don't dilligently make that same change everywhere the repeated code appears, problems will arise.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Consistency:</b> A way to locally and temporary see what a slightly change of code can have for effect., in your chrome browser, right click and choose Inspect Elements and then you can add code.  Then press refresh and code will appear. As a beginner looking at Wikipedia website and inspecting the elements you can then learn to see the patterns established.  These paterns to me are consistency.<span class="code">div</span> the same <span class="code">class</span> and then specify the style for that class in only one place! By avoiding repetion, it's now very easy for me to make changes to this style.

        CSS
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and they give programmers a way to control the style of related HTML elements. This is done by giving similar HTML elements the same <span class="code">class</span> name and then specifying the style that should apply to that class.
